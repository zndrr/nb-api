Netbox API Files

This is basically a dumping ground of Netbox API primarily for personal use in Netbox.

Once I can figure out the best way to generate various clients, they will also be included per-version (eg my work requires a csharp client)

Note: Please be advised that these API files have additional calls from plugins I have installed on my Netbox host. Overlooked that, so will need to regenerate with a clean host instead.
